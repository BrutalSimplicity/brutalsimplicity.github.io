This is the repo for my blog.

If having blogs hosted by GitHub is new to you (it was to me), then take a look at the below resources. Honestly, as a developer I've never found a platform so suitable, and so easy to maintain for those that like to share there ideas through code.

The theme of my blog is called [Gravity](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity). There are tons of themes out there, so just pick one.
